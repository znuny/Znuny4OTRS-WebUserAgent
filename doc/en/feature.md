# Functionality

Extends the web user agent module of OTRS and allows (among other things) to define URLs/hosts for which a configured proxy should not be used. Additionally, the user agent string can be changed.

This add-on renders Znuny4OTRS-EnhancedProxySupport obsolete and uninstalls it upon installation of Znuny4OTRS-WebUserAgent.
